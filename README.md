# My first Java Script - ToDo-List

##Functionality:
3 hardcoded examples in the todolist.
-Add new todo
-Remove todo
-Reset removed todos
-Delete todos
-Sort todos (moves pressed todo, to the top of the list)

##Structure:

- camelCase
- let not var
- describing variables - no commenting should be necessary
- minimal code in window onload (call functions instead)

##Comment:
This is my first project in JS. Focus in the task is to learn JS basics and working with objects. First I created two arrays, one for displaying todos, and one for removed. It was much easier to toggle between the to arrays, then I wondered if I could do it using only one array. It was a little bit more complicated to do, but I made it work. Not sure what would be preffered in the long run.

##Question for improvement:
I created the reset button in html with onclick. Since I have unique ID's on all my elements, I would like to be able to work with that for the toggle, but I do not know at this stage how to do that using the structure that I have set up the reset button with. Guidance much appreciated! :)
